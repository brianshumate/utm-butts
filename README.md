# UTM BUTTS

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brianshumate/utm-butts/master/src/icon-128.png)

This is an extension for Chromium based web browsers that replaces all
inbound Urchin Traffic Monitor (UTM) analytic tracking tokens 
(used by Google Analytics) in any URL with a single one:

```
?utm_source=BUTTS
```

## Chromium Based Browser Installation

1. Clone this repository (or grab the [utm-butts.crx](https://github.com/brianshumate/utm-butts/raw/master/utm-butts.crx))
2. In a Chromium based browser, choose **Window** > **Extensions** 
   or use the `chrome://extensions/` URL
3. Drag `utm-butts.crx` onto the page that appears
4. Send many peachy UTM sources to marketing friends everywhere
